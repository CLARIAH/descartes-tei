After a 10yr break I am playing with the idea to convert the result of this project,
a corpus in TEI with mathematical formules in TeX and then typeset in GIF images,
to Text-Fabric.

The idea is to display the formulas in TeX using the capabilities of the Jupyter Notebook, i.e.
MathJax.

Today I ran the conversion again, by means of the original Perl script.
It ran without installing anything and without modification, except for one line
in the customisation section of `convert.pl` (the path to the root of the project).

And I have a working TeX installation on this computer (MacTex, a standard install).

This run produces the TeX formulas again, ran TeX over them, and saved them as images again,
all of which are now in the repo.
